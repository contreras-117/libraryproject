This is my current Full-Stack project where I am learning new technologies such as React, TypeScript, and MySQL. This is a work-in-progress and have just created a repository for it in GitHub as of April 11, 2024.

This Full-Stack project consists of a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend with REST APIs.

This application is a Library App of Computer Science Books that are coming from a MySQL database. These are not real books, they are merely examples of computing dynamic data.

To run this app:

1. Run SpringBootLibraryApplication.java located in the backend directory
2. Navigate to the react-library directory inside of the frontend folder and run "npm start" in the terminal
3. Allow your IDE to open application on your web browser when prompted
